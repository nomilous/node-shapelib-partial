Ok, need this now. Can get none of the existing shapelib node tools to work.<br />
Feeling a little out of my depth, but, here goes... <br />

Attempt bindings for [shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/) as a [node addon](http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)

Questions
---------

* how to make the package installer compile the c source (or is that necessary?)
* how to actually compile the c source

```bash

sudo npm install -g node-gyp
node-gyp rebuild

```

* how to export the functions such that they are accessable to node
* um?
